# FiveM Utility Library with Common Bridges & UI

![FIVEM_UTILS_THUMB](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46ce9970-9a8a-4d10-b19a-2cb4bfaaec18)

A modular and feature-rich Developer Utility Library for FiveM.  
This library is designed to streamline development by providing essential tools, bridges, and a full UI kitâ€”all in one place.

## What is the point of this library?
To simplify scripting with prebuilt systems and framework/UI bridges.
It provides an array of standalone solutions and essential tools to lessen the dev load.

## What happened to `boii_utils`?
Dropped the branding to make it more open, modular, and appealing to a wider range of developers.
The intention is to try and cut down on the excessive amount of bridges needed for servers today.

## Can I use only certain parts?
Yes! The entire library is modular.
Thereâ€™s no requirement to load everything just require what you need.

# Notable Features:
- **Framework & UI Bridges:** Allows compatibility for multiple resources through one simple API.
    - Framework Bridge by default covers: `esx`, `keystone`, `nd`, `ox`, `qb`, `qbx`. 
    - Notification Bridge by default covers: `default`, `boii`, `esx`, `okok`, `ox`, `qb`
    - DrawText Bridge by default covers: `default`, `boii`, `esx`, `okok`, `ox`, `qb` 

- **Standalone Systems:** Provides a single path over framework specific systems or can provide systems to those without.  
    - Callbacks: Straight forward callback system with optional data sending.
    - Commands: Comes with database based permissions, could be moved to ace however if prefer.
    - Licences: Full in-depth licence system with support for theory, practical, a points system and revoking.
    - XP: Full XP system with experience growth factors and max levels.

- **Unique Scripting Modules:** The modules include most, if not all the functions you would need for creating things like clothing stores, multicharacter, vehicle customs etc.
    - Characters: Contains all functions needed to create a character customiser, clothing store, tattoo store etc, this set of functions was used to create the multi-character and customisation locations within the `keystone` core.
    - Vehicles: Contains virtually all functions that should be needed to create vehicle customisation scripts.

- **UI Elements:** Since one of the more recent rebuilds the library now includes a full UI suite.
    - Action Menu: Intended to be used like a radial menu, supports main and sub menus.
    - Context Menu: Simple straight forward context menu with support for header images, this one is due a big update a.s.a.p.
    - Dialogue: Can be used to create dialogue conversations for players with NPCs.
    - DrawText: Simple drawtext ui with support for timed displays.
    - Notify: Notifications to include; `success`, `error`, `info`, `warning`, `primary`, `secondary`, `light`, `dark`, `critical`, `neutral`.
    - Progress Bar: A regular timed progress bar, not much to say here.
    - Progress Circle: A progress bar? But in a circle?

Much love, and happy scripting!
